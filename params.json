{"name":"WHINT","tagline":"Whitespace language interpreter","body":"# WHINT\r\nWHINT is the interpreter of esoteric language [Whitespace](http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/tutorial.html). The following aspects of the language are not specified on that website, so I specify them here:\r\n- Firstly, all non-blank characters are treated as comments and ignored, even if they are in the middle of the command - for example [SPACE]abcd[SPACE][TAB] means the same what [SPACE][SPACE][TAB] or [SPACE][SPACE][TAB].\r\n- Secondly, heap and I/O operations which take parameters from the stack **don't** discard them but leave them on the stack.\r\n\r\nTo change the default size of the heap (1024 elements), change HEAP_SIZE value in the source code.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n### Windows\r\nRequirements:\r\n- MinGW compiler - <http://www.mingw.org/>\r\n\r\nCompile the file whint.cpp using command:  \r\n`g++ whint.cpp -o whint.exe`  \r\nRun whint.exe from command line.  \r\nNote: You can use other compiler if you want.\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\nRequirements:\r\n- GCC compiler - <https://gcc.gnu.org/>\r\n\r\nCompile the file whint.cpp using command:  \r\n`g++ whint.cpp -o whint`  \r\nRun whint from command line.  \r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n`whint [name of file to run]`\r\n\r\nFor example:  \r\n`whint program.wh`  \r\n  \r\nHAVE FUN!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
